[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findjoint_state_publisher_gui.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "joint_state_publisher_gui", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "joint_state_publisher_gui" with any of the following names:

    joint_state_publisher_guiConfig.cmake
    joint_state_publisher_gui-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "joint_state_publisher_gui" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "joint_state_publisher_gui_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "joint_state_publisher_gui" provides
  a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
