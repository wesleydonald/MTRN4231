# Project Overview 
Intended customer / end-user.  
Summary of robot functionality.  
Short [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wB0pO2BWPVrgC5FvZPbpUHrPBrPJTyYX/view?usp=drive_link)

---

# System Architecture
- Diagram of ROS2 nodes, topics, services, and actions.  
- Package-level architecture diagram.  
- Behaviour-tree or state-machine diagram.  
- Description of each node’s function.  
- List and explanation of any custom message types or interfaces.

# Technical Components

## Computer Vision
Description of the vision pipeline and its contribution to the task.

## Custom End-Effector
Photos/renders, assembly details, drawings, control overview, integration details.

## System Visualisation
Explanation of how the system is visualised (e.g., RViz) and what it demonstrates.

## Closed-Loop Operation
Description of feedback method and real-time behavioural adaptation.

---

# Installation and Setup
Step-by-step installation instructions, dependencies, workspace setup.  
Hardware setup details (UR5e, camera, Teensy, etc.).  
Environment variables, config files, calibration procedures.

---

# Running the System
Instructions for launching and running the complete system.  
Example commands.  
Expected behaviour and example outputs.  
Optional troubleshooting notes.  
System must launch via a single command.

---

# Results and Demonstration
Performance relative to design goals.  
Quantitative results (accuracy, repeatability).  
Photos/figures/videos of system operation.  
Notes on robustness, adaptability, innovation.

---

# Discussion and Future Work
Engineering challenges and how they were addressed.  
Opportunities for improvement (Version 2.0).  
What makes the approach novel or effective.

---

# Contributors and Roles
List team members and their responsibilities.
